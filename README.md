## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Proxy Configuration

For optimal performance and to avoid rate limiting, configure Apify Proxy:

```json
{
  "proxyConfiguration": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"],
    "apifyProxyCountry": "US"
  }
}
```

### Limiting Results

Control the number of jobs collected:

```json
{
  "maxItems": 1000
}
```

### Custom Search URLs

Start from specific RemoteOK pages:

```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    "https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs?search=developer",
    "https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs?page=2"
  ]
}
```

### Location and Date Filtering

When using keyword search, you can filter by location and posting date:

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "developer",
  "location": "Europe",
  "dateFilter": "week"
}
```

## üìà Examples

### Scrape Recent Software Engineering Jobs

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "software engineer",
  "maxItems": 200
}
```

### Scrape from Specific Category Pages

```json
{
  "startUrls": [
    "https://remoteok.com/remote-jobs?category=engineering"
  ],
  "maxItems": 500
}
```

### High-Volume Scraping with Proxies

```json
{
  "searchQuery": "remote",
  "maxItems": 10000,
  "proxyConfiguration": {
    "useApifyProxy": true,
    "apifyProxyGroups": ["RESIDENTIAL"]
  }
}
```

## üìù Notes

- The actor respects RemoteOK's terms of service and implements reasonable delays between requests
- Advanced anti-detection measures are applied including randomized user agents, session management, and human-like browsing patterns
- For large-scale scraping, use residential proxies to ensure stability
- Results are automatically deduplicated based on job URLs
- The actor handles RemoteOK's dynamic content loading and pagination
- If RemoteOK updates their site structure, the actor may need updates to maintain compatibility

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Low success rate**: Ensure proxy configuration is enabled for residential proxies.

**Missing data**: Some jobs may not have all fields populated on RemoteOK.

**Rate limiting**: Reduce `maxItems` or add delays if encountering blocks.

### Support

For issues or feature requests, please create an issue in the actor's repository or contact Apify support.
